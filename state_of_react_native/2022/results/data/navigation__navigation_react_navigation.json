            "Seems the best of a bad bunch. Has a fair amount of issues. ",
            " don't want to use React navigation because it feels janky and slow even with its native stack Navigator. Though that's the best choice we have available today and I hope we find better and faster navigation solutions.",
            "Well-built. Has most stuff in mind (deep link management, wrapping Native navigation APIs, Type safety for routes and params)",
            "androdi’s performance issue’s are still exist, especially on 4+ hours sessions ",
            "would love better support for global modals/toasts/overlays",
            "Another really awesome library ",
            "Only begrudgingly, because every time I come back to React Native, the API changes for the better and it makes all my legacy code completely worthless, and the documentation often misses common configurations or cases I have to hack around until months later I discover there was a way to do that the whole time but it's only mentioned in a blog post.",
            "Still missing the render as you fetch pattern unfortunately ",
            "Not good as navigation react native. feels of mixing native and react. not feel a native exp. as a developer. api too complicated and forces to think one way and use it. bad on web and too buggy. not good at github issue handling. when I facing an error, first I will look solution like searching on github issues, googles and source codes etc. and when I can't find any related issue, I find myself to forces to find another hacky way instead of opening issues. one issue I opened a years ago and it turns out auto closed one. no one's answer my issue nor labelling it. sadly, I find react-navigation one-man's repo.",
