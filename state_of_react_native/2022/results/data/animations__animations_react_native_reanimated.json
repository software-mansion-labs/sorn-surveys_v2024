            "Has had severe memory problems since 2.0 came out. Surprised not much noise has been made about this seeing as it underpins lots of widely used libraries in the eco-system. Perhaps most apps aren't used for long periods of time so it's not as s noticeable. Ours is used for many hours and often crashes due to out of memory errors related to this library. Hoping version 3 resolves this. ",
            "We are using it because of it is probably the only good solution in term of performances but it is terrible to install and to understand.\nThe docs are terrible too\n\nBut the job behind is still appreciated ",
