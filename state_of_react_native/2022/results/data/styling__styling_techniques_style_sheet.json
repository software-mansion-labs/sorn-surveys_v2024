I would like to use an approach as closest as possible to \"vanilla\" .css stylesheets. \n\nAlso debugging styles in Dev Tools inspector because of hard-tp-read classnames is super hard.\n\nI miss some \"best practices\" handbook to follow about styling because I feel that different approaches get mixed.\n",
