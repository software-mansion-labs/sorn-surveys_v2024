            "It's great but it needs to get more features because the Stylesheet API is falling behind web standards. Grids from CSS is a dream.",
            "I dont like CSSinJS. I would like to use an approach as closest as possible to \"vanilla\" .css stylesheets. \n\nAlso debugging styles in Dev Tools inspector because of hard-tp-read classnames is super hard.\n\nI miss some \"best practices\" handbook to follow about styling because I feel that different approaches get mixed.\n",
