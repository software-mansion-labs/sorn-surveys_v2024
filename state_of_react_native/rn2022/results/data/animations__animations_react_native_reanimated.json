            "Has had severe memory problems since 2.0 came out. Surprised not much noise has been made about this seeing as it underpins lots of widely used libraries in the eco-system. Perhaps most apps aren't used for long periods of time so it's not as s noticeable. Ours is used for many hours and often crashes due to out of memory errors related to this library. Hoping version 3 resolves this. ",
            "We are using it because of it is probably the only good solution in term of performances but it is terrible to install and to understand.\nThe docs are terrible too\n\nBut the job behind is still appreciated ",
            "With a couple of notes: Layout animations is kind of crappy on Android and be careful with some of the Animations cause they might cause crashes",
            "My favorite lib. Thanks for this awesome lib",
            "There is a learning curve and an installation cost, but overall improves the app a lot!",
            "Absolutely love Reanimated (we're always on bleeding edge), but debugging has been kind of a nightmare with cryptic stacktraces and weird errors that aren't quite as approachable for folks not 100% familiar with how the library works under the hood.",
            "Reanimated have great api but terrible support. When you meet a bug, you can spend any many days to investigate and found a reasob",
