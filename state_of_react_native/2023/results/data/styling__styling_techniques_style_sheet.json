            "Good API. Works like a charm. Not the quickest one to write stuff in or the most scalable (Especially if you have themes and specific paddings and margin and font styles that are part of a design system) but it is good and reliable. Like writing CSS on web",

            "It's great but it needs to get more features because the Stylesheet API is falling behind web standards. Grids from CSS is a dream.",
            "I dont like CSSinJS. I would like to use an approach as closest as possible to \"vanilla\" .css stylesheets. \n\nAlso debugging styles in Dev Tools inspector because of hard-tp-read classnames is super hard.\n\nI miss some \"best practices\" handbook to follow about styling because I feel that different approaches get mixed.\n",

            "Too many discrepancies between platform, make it impossible to just test on one platform our design",
